		<h1>Maze game tutotial (part 1)</h1>
		<p>Here is something fun for amusement. I love to implement small funny games in JavaScript and have
		a lot og games on <a href="http://steffengrondahl.dk/spil.html" target="_blank">my homesite</a> (and please 
		notice, my homesite is in danish!).</p>
		<p>My last game is a <a href="http://steffengrondahl.dk/spil_labyrint.html" target="_blank">maze game</a>.</p>
		<p>In this tutorial I will show how to implement a simple version of the game. Focus is on how to implement
		the game, not to make it particular challenging and fun to play, nor to make it particular visual appealing. However,
		having learned how implement a basic version of the game, it is easy to expand it to more a complicated maze (and thus
		much more challenging and fun). Making it better looking isn't either very difficult, as I did it on my  
		<a href="http://steffengrondahl.dk/spil_labyrint.html" target="_blank">homepage</a>.</p>
		<p>I have chosen to split the tuitorial in two parts:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In this part I will show how to implement the necessary HTML code for the visuals and the needed JavaScript 
			code for movement in the maze.</li>
			<li>In part 2 I will show how to construct the maze dynamic using an algorithm.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The goal is to implement a simple maze game, where the player can move inside the maze using buttons, that
		simulates the arrow keys on a keyboard (and yes you can also implement movement using the keyboard arrow keys as has been 
		done on my <a href="http://steffengrondahl.dk/spil_labyrint.html" target="_blank">homepage</a>). The maze has to look
		something like this:</p>

		<div style="position: relative; height: 122px;">
			<button id="up" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 181px; width: 60px; height: 60px;">&#8593;</button>
			<button id="left" style="position: absolute; top: 61px; left: 120px; width: 60px; height: 60px;">&#8592;</button>
			<button id="down" style="position: absolute; top: 61px; left: 181px; width: 60px; height: 60px;">&#8595;</button>
			<button id="right" style="position: absolute; top: 61px; left: 242px; width: 60px; height: 60px;">&#8594;</button>
		</div>
		<p>Obviously, a press on the button with arrow up (&#8593;) will move the yellow circle (the players marker) up and likewise 
		pressing the arrow left, right and down button will move the yellow circle in left, right and down. However, the movement should 
		of course only be possible provided the yellow circle isn't hitting a wall in the maze.</p>
		<h2>HTML code</h2>
		<p>The HTML code is relatively simple. The maze is implemented as a inline SVG element (or image - the SVG can both be considered 
		as a image format and a HTML element) and the buttons have been places in relative positioned HTML DIV element, so have them
		aligned correct:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The SVG element contains four sub elemenets. The two first sub elements are squares (<span>&lt;rect&gt;</span>), one green, 
			the other blue. These squares visualize the area for the maze: the blue square is the background for maze. The group element  
			(<span>&lt;g&gt;</span>) is next. It contains sub elements, all line element (<span>&lt;line&gt;</span>), each of them 
			visalizing a wall or a part of a wall in the maze. The last element is a yellow filled circle (<span>&lt;circle&gt;</span>),
			the player marker which have to be moved through the maze. One notices, the circle and the group element have an id, and 
			thus can be accesses with JavaScript DOM.</li>
			<li>The four buttons are positioned absolute in a relative positioned div element. Each of them have an id, so they can be 
			accessed with JavaScript DOM.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Basic movement of the player marker (yellow circle)</h2>
		<p>The chosen maze is characterized not only by being quadratic, the placement of the maze walls shows that the maze is 
		implemented as a grid with dimension 5 times 5. This is easiest to recognize by adding the following lines 
		(<span>&lt;line&gt;</span> element) to the SVG element (immediately after the two <span>&lt;rect&gt;</span> elements):</p>

		</svg>
		<p>Besides the lines, indices from 0 to 4 have been added for the 5 rows and 5 columns in the grid. Thus the yellow player marker 
		will initially be in the row with index 4 and the column with index 0. Moving the player markers means moving it from one cell
		(with a specific index for row and column) to a neighbor cell (where one of the two indices will be either one value greater 
		or smaller). For isnstance, moving the player marker up, means changing the row index from 4 to 3. We can use this simple relation 
		between movement, row and column indices to implment a function for drawing the players marker after movement::</p>
		<pre>
	&lt;script&gt;
		var current_column = 0;
		var current_row = 3;
	
		function move_marker() { 
			var x = parseInt(91 + 60*current_column);
			var y = parseInt(91 + 60*current_row);
			var marker = document.getElementById("marker");
			marker.setAttributeNS(null,"transform","translate("+x+","+y+")");
		}

	&lt;/script&gt;	
		</pre>
		<p>One notice that the movement of the player marker is done by setting the attributte "transform" on the marker SVG element (i.e., 
		the circle element). To do so, one first have to calculate the corrdinates for the actuel row (<span>current_row</span>) and
		column (<span>current_column</span>) including an offset, as the maze is shifted both left and down from the top of the SVG element.</p>
		<p>Using the above function, one can easily implement a preliminary function for movement to the left, triggered by presing the
		button with the left arrow:</p>
		<pre>
	&lt;script&gt;
		document.getElementById("left").addEventListener("click",move_left,false);
	
		function move_left() { 
			current_column--;
			move_marker();
		}

	&lt;/script&gt;	
		</pre>
		<p>First we catch the button pressed by appending a event listerner for the click event and let the function <span>move_left</span>
		handle this event. Second we just count the current columnt one down and call the <span>move_marker</span> function.</p>
		<p>This is working, however with a serious flaw: The movement doesn't respect the walls of the maze, but continues right through as
		though the wall didn't exist at all. Thus we need a way to handle these walls. First we need to describe where the walls are.</p>
		
		<h2>Description of the walls in the maze</h2>
		<p>The maze contains a number of vertical and horizontal walls. As a matter of fact on can perceive a wall as a continuous
		set of a pieces, each placed on an edge of a cell in the grid. Thus we will percieve the walls as a number of small pieces, each making 
		an edge of a cell in the grid.</p>
		<p>The vertical and horizontal (pieces of) wall can be described independent of each other. We will start describing the vertival 
		walls.</p>
		<p>For each row in the grid of the maze, there can be up to 6 (pieces of) vertical walls. In the first row, we thus have 3 walls: 
		One on the far left and two on the far right. Between these there are 3 cell edged where there could have been a wall, but isn't.
		We can describe this with an array:</p>
		<pre>
		[true, false, false, false, true, true]
		</pre>
		<p>This boolean array tells for each cell edge if there is a (piec of) wall or not. The example shows the we have a (piece of) wall
		at the first edge and the last two, but none on the other edged. Similar we can easily describe the vertical walls in the other
		rows of the maze, using an boolean array for each row. And this can be gathered in a double array, here called
		<span>vertical_walls</span>:</p>
		<pre>
	&lt;script&gt;
		var vertical_walls = []; 
		vertical_walls[0] = [true, false, false, false, true, true];
		vertical_walls[1] = [true, true, false, true, true, true];
		vertical_walls[2] = [true, true, false, true, true, true];
		vertical_walls[3] = [true, true, true, true, false, true];
		vertical_walls[4] = [true, false, true, false, false, true];
	&lt;/script&gt;	
		</pre>
		<p>One notice the first index in the double array refers to the row and the second index to the column. Thus</p>
		<pre>
			vertical_walls[4][1]
		</pre>
		<p>refers to the second (possible) wall on the lower row (which by the way is <span>false</span> in our maze).</p>
		<p>The horizontal walls are described in a similar manner with a double array. However here we chose to look at the
		array so each entry (row) in the array describes the walls in the particular column in the maze. Thus the double array,
		<span>horizontal_walls</span> looks like this:</p>
		<pre>
	&lt;script&gt;
		var horizontal_walls = []; 
		horizontal_walls[0] = [true, false, false, false, false, true];
		horizontal_walls[1] = [true, true, false, true, false, true];
		horizontal_walls[2] = [true, false, true, false, false, true];
		horizontal_walls[3] = [true, false, false, true, false, true];
		horizontal_walls[4] = [false, false, false, false, true, true];
	&lt;/script&gt;	
		</pre>
		<p>In this souble array the first index refers to the column (in the maze) and the second index refers to the row (in
		the maze). This is opposite <span>vertical_walls</span>.</p>
		<h2>Correkt implementation of movement</h2>
		<p>Now having a implemention the the walls in the maze we can implement correct functions for movement in the maze.
		First we update the implementation of moving the players marker left:</p>
		<pre>
	&lt;script&gt;
		document.getElementById("left").addEventListener("click",move_left,false);
	
		function move_left() { 
			if(vertical_walls[current_row][current_column]) {
				alert("Bump - you can't go left!");
			}
			else {
				current_column--;
				move_marker();
			}
		}

	&lt;/script&gt;	
		</pre>
		<p>Movemnt to the right is siomilar, however here we have to look out for walls to the right in the current cell (thus
		we add one to the current column index):</p>
		<pre>
	&lt;script&gt;
		document.getElementById("right").addEventListener("click",move_right,false);
	
		function move_right() { 
			if(vertical_walls[current_row][current_column+1]) {
				alert("Bump - you can't go right");
			}
			else {
				current_column++;
				move_marker();
			}
		}

	&lt;/script&gt;	
		</pre>
		<p>In the implementation of up and doen movent is done similar, but now using the <span>horizontal_walls</span> arrays, 
		as the horizontal wall are the ones to look out for. Remembering that the first index for this double array is for maze
		column we have:</p>
		<pre>
	&lt;script&gt;
		document.getElementById("up").addEventListener("click",move_up,false);
	
		function move_up() { 
			if(horizontal_walls[current_column][current_row]) {
				alert("Bump - you can't go up!");
			}
			else {
				current_row--;
				move_marker();
			}
		}

		document.getElementById("down").addEventListener("click",move_down,false);
	
		function move_down() { 
			if(horizontal_walls[current_column][current_row+1]) {
				alert("Bump - you can't go down!");
			}
			else {
				current_row++;
				move_marker();
			}
		}

	&lt;/script&gt;	
		</pre>
		<h2>Out of the maze</h2>
		<p>There is still a single detail we need to fix: When getting out of the maze the game should stop and the player
		informed that (s)he has escaped the maze. </p>
		<p>It it actually quite easy to trace when the player has escaped the maze: Moving out of the maze means moving up
		from from maze row with <span>current_row = 0</span> and thus we get at state where <span>current_row</span>
		is -1. Thus we Look for this state in the function  <span>move_up</span>:</p>
		<pre>
	&lt;script&gt;
		document.getElementById("up").addEventListener("click",move_up,false);
	
		function move_up() { 
			if(horizontal_walls[current_column][current_row]) {
				alert("Bump - you can't go up!");
			}
			else {
				current_row--;
				move_marker();
				if(current_row == -1) {
					alert("Congratulation - you got out of the maze");
					current_row = 4;
					current_column = 0;
					move_marker();
				}
			}
		}
	&lt;/script&gt;
		</pre>
		<p>Now we a a working game. We will improve this furteher in the part 2 of this tutorial.</p>
